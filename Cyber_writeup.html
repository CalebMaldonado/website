        <section id="overview1">
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>This room by TryHackMe simulates a scenario in which a SOC analyst investigates suspicious
                activity across multiple Windows hosts. The exercise focuses on analyzing event logs ingested into Splunk to identify
                potential backdoor access and signs of compromise. Data sources include standard Windows event logs that reveal anomalous
                behavior suggesting unauthorized access. By querying and correlating log data, the analyst is tasked
                with uncovering indicators of compromise (IOCs) and reconstructing the attacker’s actions. This hands-on lab
                builds foundational skills in log analysis, threat detection, and incident investigation, key responsibilities
                of a SOC Level 1 analyst.</p>
            <h3>Task 1 Investigating with Splunk</h3>
                <p>SOC Analyst Johny has observed some anomalous behaviours in the logs of a few windows machines. It
                looks like the adversary has access to some of these machines and successfully created some backdoor. His manager
                has asked him to pull those logs from suspected hosts and ingest them into Splunk for quick investigation. Our task
                as SOC Analyst is to examine the logs and identify the anomalies.

                To learn more about Splunk and how to investigate the logs, look at the rooms splunk101 and splunk201.

                Room MachineBefore moving forward, deploy the machine. When you deploy the machine, it will be assigned an IP <strong>Machine IP:</strong>
                <code>MACHINE_IP</code>. You can visit this IP from the VPN or the Attackbox. The machine will take up to 3-5 minutes to start. All the
                required logs are ingested in the index main.</p>

            <h3>Environment Setup</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>This lab was completed in the <strong>SOC Level 1</strong> room on <strong>TryHackMe</strong>, which simulates a real-world SOC analyst workflow.</li>
        <li><strong>Splunk SIEM</strong> was used to ingest and analyze logs from suspected Windows hosts.</li>
        <li>Log sources included:
            <ul>
                <li>Windows Security Logs (e.g., logon events, privilege usage)</li>
                <li>Sysmon Logs (e.g., process creation, network activity)</li>
                <li>PowerShell Operational Logs</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>All analysis was done through a pre-configured, browser-accessible Splunk instance hosted by TryHackMe</li>
        <li>This environment provided a realistic opportunity to practice threat detection, event correlation, and incident response using industry-standard tools.</li>

        <h2>Investigation Questions & Answers</h2>

        <p><strong>How many events were collected and ingested in the index "main"?</strong><br>
        <strong>Answer:</strong> 12,256</p>

        <p><em>Query:</em><code>index="main"</code></p>

        <img src="question1.png" alt="Query 1 Screenshot" width="870" class="responsive-img">

        <p><strong>On one of the infected hosts, the adversary was successful in creating a backdoor user. What is the new username?</strong><br>
        <strong>Answer:</strong> A1berto</p>

        <p><strong>Event ID 4720</strong> is logged whenever a user account is created on Windows Security Event Log</p>

        <p><em>Query:</em> <code>index="main" EventID="4720"</code></p>

        <img src="question2.png" alt="Query 2 Screenshot" width="870" class="responsive-img">

        <p><strong>On the same host, a registry key was also updated regarding the new backdoor user. What is the full path of that registry key?</strong><br>
        <strong>Answer:</strong> <pre class="code-block"><code>HKLM\SAM\SAM\Domains\Account\Users\Names\A1berto</code></pre></p>

        The first thing I did was to look up for Event ID 13 and see if there were any relevant changes to the registry key. Once there I refined my search to
        focus on the specific registry path associated with the new user account (A1berto).</p>

        <p><em>Query:</em> <code>index="main" EventID=13 A1berto</code></p>

        <img src="question3.png" alt="Query 3 Screenshot" width="870" class="responsive-img">

        <p><strong>Examine the logs and identify the user that the adversary was trying to impersonate.</strong><br>
        <strong>Answer:</strong> Alberto</p>
        
        <p>The names of users are found in the “User” field. The newly created user “A1berto” is not the same as “Alberto”; therefore, “Alberto” is the likely impersonation target.</p>
        
        <p><em>Query:</em> <code>index="main"</code></p>

        <img src="question4.png" alt="Query 4 Screenshot" width="870" class="responsive-img">

        <p><strong>What is the command used to add a backdoor user from a remote computer?</strong><br>
        <strong>Answer:</strong> <code>C:\windows\System32\Wbem\WMIC.exe” /node:WORKSTATION6 process call create “net user /add A1berto paw0rd1</code></p>

        <p>I filtered for the Sysmon EventID 1, which is for process creation. I then applied the A1berto username and found the answer as the first result in the
        "CommandLine" field.</p>

        <p><em>Query:</em> <code>index="main" EventID=1 A1berto</code></p>

        <img src="question5.png" alt="Query 5 Screenshot" width="870" class="responsive-img">

        <p><strong>How many times was the login attempt from the backdoor user observed during the investigation?</strong><br>
        <strong>Answer:</strong> 0</p>
        
        <p>I then decided to check for successful (4624) and failed (4625) logon events involving the backdoor user. However, no events were found and that ended up being the answer.</p>
        <p><em>Query:</em> <code>index="main" EventID="4625" OR EventID="4624" A1berto</code></p>

        <img src="question6.png" alt="Query 6 Screenshot" width="870" class="responsive-img">

        <p><strong>What is the name of the infected host on which suspicious PowerShell commands were executed?</strong><br>
        <strong>Answer:</strong> James.browne</p>
        <p>These event IDs represent PowerShell script block logging and command invocation. The hostname can be found in the event fields.</p>
        <p><em>Query:</em> <code>index="main" PowerShell/code></p>
        <img src="question7.png" alt="Query 7 Screenshot" width="870" class="responsive-img">

        <p><strong>PowerShell logging is enabled on this device. How many events were logged for the malicious PowerShell execution?</strong><br>
        <strong>Answer:</strong> 79</p>
        <p>These event IDs represent PowerShell script block logging(4104) and command invocation(4103).</p>
        <p><em>Query:</em> <code>index="main" EventID="4104" OR EventID="4103"</code></p>
        <img src="question7.png" alt="Query 7 Screenshot" width="870" class="responsive-img">

        <p><strong>An encoded Powershell script from the infected host initiated a web request. What is the full URL?</strong><br>
        <strong>Answer:</strong> hxxp[://]10[.]10[.]10[.]5/news[.]php</p>
        <p>I used the same query as the previous question, I then looked into the ContextInfo field and found almost every result had the same encrypted string</p>
        <img src="question81.png" alt="Query 8 Screenshot" width="870" class="responsive-img">
        <p>I then wanted to get only the Host Application section to see if there were any other encrypted strings. I used <code>| rex field=ContextInfo "Host Application = (?<Command>[^\r\n]+)"</code></p>
        <p>After that I wanted to make sure that the contents of the newly created "Command" field does not get duplicated so I used <code>| dedup Command</code> This lead me to this:</p>
        <img src="question82.png" alt="Query 9 Screenshot" width="870" class="responsive-img">
        <p>I then extracted the string, ran it through cyberchef, and decoded it using base64.</p>
        <img src="question83.png" alt="Query 10 Screenshot" width="870" class="responsive-img">
        <p>From there I got the IP address and defanged it.</p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Completing the SOC Level 1 room on TryHackMe gave me hands-on experience
        in using Splunk to investigate a simulated Windows compromise. I practiced
        querying different event types — including account creation, PowerShell execution,
        and registry modifications — to identify malicious behavior and trace an adversary’s actions across multiple hosts.</p>

        <p>This exercise helped sharpen my log analysis skills, especially in recognizing user impersonation, detecting
        backdoor accounts, and using Splunk queries to pivot across correlated events. I also became more confident in
        identifying key Windows Event IDs and using them to piece together an attack timeline.</p>

        <p>From a SOC analyst perspective, this lab mirrored real-world detection and triage processes. It strengthened
        my understanding of how SIEM tools support threat detection, incident response, and root cause analysis. These are skills
        I aim to bring to an entry-level SOC role, where staying alert to anomalies and understanding attacker behavior is essential
        to protecting enterprise systems.</p>
